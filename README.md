## Hi there, i'm Samuele and im looking for a job in Web Development ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a dummy app to demo the MVC architecture using JavaScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git and GitHub so others (hopefully employers) can checkout my code and my current level.
- âœ… In the meanwhile you can checkout my Porfolio-Website repository!
